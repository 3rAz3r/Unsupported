Unsupported Zenphoto scripts

The scripts found here are a collection of enhancements to Zenphoto that are not directly suported by the Zenphoto team.

The files in the "extension" folder would be placed in the "plugin" folder of your installation. Be sure that you copy both the script and any like named folder. 

The folders in the "themes" folder are third party themes that are not hosted by the theme developer. Place the folder and its contents into your installation "themes" folder.

Please remember that these scripts are provided for your use and education but are not supported by the Zenphoto team. This is true even if a team member originally created them.
